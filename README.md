# d4 project

*This version of d4 can also be compiled on Apple Silicon Macs.*

In order to compile the project cmake (version>=3.1) and ninja have to
be installed. The following command lines then build and compile the
project as a static executable.

```console
$ ./build.sh -s
```

The executable is called d4 and is in the build repository.

```console
$ ./build/d4 -h
```
